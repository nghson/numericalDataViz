Wed 16.3 progress:
    - Tried using scalafx to create lines for line diagram.
    - Scalafx's methods to create Line objects and add them to a scene have been tested.
    - No errors so far.
    - Due to a change in my schedule, I started the project a bit late so little has been done. The work load is approximately 10 hours.
    - Right now I'm a bit lagging behind compared to the plan, but I expect to spend more time now to catch up.

Wed 30.3 progress:
	- Unfortunately, no progress was made to the project. I will try to catch up to the plan quickly.

Wed 13.4 progress:
	- Classes Point, Data and LineData have been implemented
	- Method loadData of LineData has been tested and would work if LineData is not a subclass of Data
	- Some difficulty with Circe for reading JSON file was encountered
	- Due to the exam week, I could not invest  a lot of time for the project so it is still behind schedule, hopefully I can catch up and finish by the deadline.
